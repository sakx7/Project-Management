## Summary

The project is to **design a family board game** featuring a suspenseful play pattern that culminates in a dramatic, triggered surprise. 

The game must be safe, visually appealing, easy for children aged 4+, highly replayable, and manufacturable at low cost.

Students will combine creative design, mechanical engineering for the surprise mechanism, and market-oriented thinking, including packaging design and a 30-second promotional video, to create a memorable and commercially viable “wow moment.”
