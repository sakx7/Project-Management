## Summary

The project is to **conduct a conceptual design study to optimise a valvetrain system** for a high-performance engine operating up to 15,000 rpm. 

Students will compare different valve actuation strategies and architectures, evaluating trade-offs in performance, friction, mass, durability, manufacturability, and cost.

The focus is on theoretical analysis supported by CAD, demonstrating how engineering decisions influence overall system performance in a high-stakes environment like Formula 1.
