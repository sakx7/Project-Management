## Summary

The project is to **design a modular intake and exhaust system** for a single-cylinder research engine that emulates the airflow and performance characteristics of a Formulaâ€¯1 V6 engine. 

The system should feature swappable components to illustrate how design changes affect torque, efficiency, and other performance metrics.

Students will develop a flexible test rig supported by CAD, analysis, and a test plan, emphasizing fundamental engine development principles rather than replicating proprietary designs.
