## Summary

The project is to **design a conceptual frame** for assembling and maintaining a large-scale electrolyser vessel. 

The frame must safely handle heavy internal components (up to 3 tons) within a 13-ton outer vessel, ensuring operator safety, ergonomic handling, and alignment accuracy, with potential automation to improve efficiency.

Students will focus on practical industrial challenges, workflow optimization, and risk mitigation while evaluating vertical and horizontal assembly approaches.
