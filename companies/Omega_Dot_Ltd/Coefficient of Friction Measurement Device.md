## Summary

The project is to **design, build, and validate a device** that accurately measures the kinetic coefficient of friction between coating samples and a shaft material. 

The device must rotate a shaft at 1,000â€¯rpm against a stationary sample, measure frictional force, and calculate the coefficient to support replacement of a soon-to-be-restricted PTFE coating.

Students will create a functional, safe, and easy-to-use prototype using commercially available parts, generating critical real-world data to guide material selection.
