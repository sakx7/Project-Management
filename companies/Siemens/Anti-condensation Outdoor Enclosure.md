## Summary

The project is to **design an outdoor switch gear enclosure** that prevents internal condensation. 

The solution may combine passive strategies (ventilation, insulation) with active systems (heating) and must be manufacturable, cost-effective, and compliant with IEC standards.

Students will integrate mechanical design, thermal/environmental analysis, and electrical safety to enhance the reliability and longevity of critical infrastructure.
