## Summary

The project is to **design an AI-Guided Adaptive Car Seat** that adjusts support zones (e.g., lumbar, thigh) in response to posture and pressure data, aiming to improve comfort and reduce fatigue on long drives.

Students will explore smart seating technologies, then develop a simplified concept with embedded sensors and basic rule-based adjustment logic. The design should consider ergonomics, feasibility for CAD prototyping, sustainability, and simplicity.
