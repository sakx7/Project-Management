## Summary

The project is to **design a modular cooling system for Electric Vehicle battery packs** that maintains optimal temperatures and can be adapted across different vehicle platforms, with a focus on manufacturability and thermal management.

Students will review existing cooling methods (air, liquid, phase-change), analyze their limitations, and propose a scalable modular design compatible with multiple architectures. 

The concept should emphasize effective thermal regulation, ease of manufacturing, and adaptability, supported by CAD modeling for visualization.
