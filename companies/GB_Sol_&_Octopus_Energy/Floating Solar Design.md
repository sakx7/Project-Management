## Summary

The project is to **design a modular floating solar energy system** that is scalable, cost-effective, and adaptable to various aquatic environments, such as lakes and reservoirs. 

The system must address key challenges including durability in harsh weather, ease of maintenance, and minimal impact on aquatic ecosystems.

Students will create a practical, sustainable solution that leverages floating solar benefits, such as improved panel efficiency from water cooling, and explores integration with existing hydroelectric infrastructure for more reliable energy generation.
