## **Supercritical Solutions – Vessel Lid Handling Frame**

### **The Situation**

- Supercritical Solutions operates a **large process vessel** used in electrolyser systems.
- The **vessel** weighs about **13 tons** and measures roughly **870 mm in diameter** and **3 metres in internal height**.
- Attached to the **underside of the vessel lid** is a **3-ton block of internal equipment** (about 2 metres tall).

---

### **The Maintenance Challenge**

- To service or replace the internal equipment, the **lid and the equipment block** must be **lifted completely out of the vessel**.
- After maintenance, the combined assembly must be **lowered back in and precisely seated**.
- The internal equipment fits very tightly inside the vessel — there is only **about 16 cm (6 inches) of clearance on each side**.
- Because of that small clearance, even a small sideways movement during lowering could cause the equipment to **strike the vessel wall**, leading to **damage or misalignment**.

---

### **The Core Problem**

> The current lifting method allows small **side-to-side or swinging motion** during lowering.  
> The operation needs a way to **guide the lid and equipment assembly precisely into place** — straight down, with no lateral movement.

---

### **Project Goal / Expected Outcome / Success Criteria**

✅ **Objective:**  
Develop a **guiding frame structure** that ensures precise, vertical installation of a vessel lid and attached equipment.

✅ **Requirements:**
- Mounts **over or around** the vessel opening.
- **Maintains lid alignment** — allowing only vertical motion and preventing lateral contact with the vessel walls.
- Provides **rigid guidance** to handle incidental side loads.
- Can be **attached, removed, and reinstalled** safely and easily.
- Compatible with **existing lifting systems**.
- Allows the lid and equipment to be **reinserted accurately and repeatably** without touching vessel surfaces.
- Constructed from **readily available, workshop-fabricable components** (e.g. steel sections, bushings, rollers).    

✅ **Success Criteria:**  
The guiding frame reliably centers and guides the lid assembly through vertical motion, enables safe installation and removal, and ensures the lid seats correctly in its designed position every time.

### **In Simple Terms**

> “Design a large, simple **guiding frame** that makes sure a 3-ton lid and equipment assembly goes **straight in and out of a narrow vessel opening** — without hitting anything.”
