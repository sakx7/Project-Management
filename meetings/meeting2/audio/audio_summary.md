This is the second project meeting, focused on **planning the project approach and preparing for a key client meeting on Friday.**

**Key Discussion Points:**

1.  **Project Documentation & Structure:**
    *   Speaker 1 has started a **master document** that will serve as a log book, the basis for the final poster, and a repository for all project information. They emphasize that while not directly submitted, this document is essential for building the final deliverables.
    *   The group discusses following a structured project timeline (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) and plans to create a **Gantt chart** to assign roles and track progress. Speaker 3 volunteers to work on the Gantt chart.

2.  **Preparation for the Friday Client Meeting:**
    *   The primary goal is to generate a list of **clarifying questions** for the client.
    *   The plan for the meeting is twofold:
        *   **First:** Present their interpretation of the project brief to the client for **validation**.
        *   **Second:** Ask their prepared list of specific, well-thought-out questions.
    *   The team is tasked with reading the project brief individually and submitting their questions by Thursday so they can consolidate them and present a unified front.

3.  **Team Coordination and Timeline:**
    *   The group discusses the project schedule, including a upcoming break, and plans for future client meetings (anticipating only 2-3 meetings in total).
    *   Speaker 1 will share resources and the master document via a shared drive/website for transparency and logging.
    *   There is an emphasis on ensuring everyone is on the same page and understands the project scope before the client meeting.

**Conclusion:**
The meeting successfully outlines the team's workflow, delegates initial tasks (Gantt chart, question generation), and establishes a clear plan for the important upcoming client meeting. The focus is on organization, clear communication, and using the client interaction to solidify their understanding of the project requirements.
