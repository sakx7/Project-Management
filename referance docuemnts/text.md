    Present the **Product Design Specification (PDS)** and describe how the design was optimized to meet system requirements.
- **Quality Plan and Quality Register**  
    Include both the **Quality Plan** and **Quality Register**, showing how quality was monitored and controlled through development. These should define checkpoints and actions to maintain high standards.
- **Continuous Improvement via PDCA Cycle**  
    Explain how the **PDCA cycle** (Plan-Do-Check-Act) was used to continuously improve and optimize system performance with feedback loops.


### **Control (C)**

- **Final Implementation Plan**  
    Discuss the final implementation plan and how project goals and timelines were achieved.
- **Risk Mitigation**  
    Present the **final Risk Mitigation Plan**, showing how risks identified earlier (via DFMEA and risk assessment) were managed or reduced.
- **Sustainability and Long-Term Impact**  
    Reflect on how the design incorporates long-term **sustainability** and **system integration**, considering environmental and lifecycle factors.
- **Final Quality Check**  
    Revisit the **Quality Plan** and **Register** to document how quality was maintained during final stages.  Ensure all goals related to **performance**, **customer satisfaction**, and **sustainability** were met.

---

## **3. Conclusion**

- **Project Outcomes**  
    Summarize key results and explain how the final concept met both system-wide and project-specific objectives.
- **Graduate Attributes**  
    Highlight the development of key skills such as **teamwork**, **communication**, and **critical thinking**.
- **Future Recommendations**  
    Suggest future improvements or developments, linking back to **systems thinking** and the **DMAIC framework**.

---

## **4. Appendices**

- **Meeting Minutes**  
    Include minutes from meetings with the industry partner, showing how their feedback was incorporated into project decisions.

---

## **5. Guidance on Tool Placement**

| Tool                                  | Placement         | Purpose                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Objective Tree Diagram (OTD)**      | Define            | Outlines project goals and how they translate into objectives.                    |
| **Quality Function Deployment (QFD)** | Define & Analyse  | Shows how customer needs were integrated into design and concept selection.       |
| **Quality Plan & Register**           | Improve & Control | Demonstrates how quality standards were set, monitored, and maintained.           |
| **Risk Assessments (incl. DFMEA)**    | Analyse & Control | Identifies risks early and tracks how they were mitigated throughout the project. |
| **SWOT Analysis**                     | Measure           | Evaluates internal and external factors that could impact the project.            |
