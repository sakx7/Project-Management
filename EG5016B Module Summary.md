[**Assignment 1: Project Presentation (70% of module grade)**](referance%20docuemnts/Assignment%201%20EG5016B_canvas-1.pdf)

This is a two-part assignment based on a group project for a real industry client.
*   **Part A (40%):** **A group A0 poster** presenting your final design concept, using a reverse-engineering approach to show how tools like VoC, OTD, and DFMEA shaped the outcome. You will be individually assessed on your part of the live presentation.
*   **Part B (30%):** **An individual report (20-30 pages)** that details your personal application of project management methods, structured around the DMAIC framework. You must emphasize your strongest individual contributions.
